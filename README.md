BirdPoop-Game
=============

Game files for the Bird Poop source mod. 

Installation
-------------------------
Drop these files into a subfolder of Steam/SteamApps/Sourcemods directory.
Restart Steam.

Requirements
-------------------------
This mod requires both VR mode (oculus rift) AND an xbox 360 controller attached.

This mod also requires Half-Life 2 to be installed, launched at least once and converted to SteamPipe (should happen automatically if you launched it recently). 

To launch in VR mode, append -vr to the [startup parameters](http://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1040-JWMT-2947) just as you would in TF2.

How-To
-------------------------
Type maps * in the console to get a listing of HL2 maps, pick a map and fly! This has only been tested on d1\_trainstation\_02

Left trigger flaps left wing, right trigger flaps right. Hold triggers to glide.

Known Issues
-------------------------
When flying, your crosshair should always face forward of your seagull, sometimes this is moved up/down and can affect your flight speed. Move it back to the center if it moves with your right stick. 

This was thrown together in 2 days for use on a single computer, I haven't even remotely tested this on any other systems and I can't promise it will even work. Feel free to email me @ jimbomcb@gmail.com for help if you can't figure anything out.

This will probably not work on any map other than d1\_trainstation\_02, this is a simple extension of HL2 and it appears picking up weapons freezes the game. This is easily fixed if you feel like working with the source.
